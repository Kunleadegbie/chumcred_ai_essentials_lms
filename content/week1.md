## 3️⃣ Core Reading Content

### 3.1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, language understanding, and decision-making.

AI does **not** mean machines think like humans.  
It means machines process **data and patterns** to produce useful outcomes.

**Examples of AI in everyday life:**
- Voice assistants (Siri, Google Assistant)
- Email spam filters
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube)
- Chatbots like ChatGPT

---

### 3.2 Traditional AI vs Generative AI

**Traditional AI**
- Rule-based or statistical
- Predicts or classifies outcomes
- Examples:
  - Credit scoring
  - Fraud detection
  - Face recognition

**Generative AI**
- Creates new content
- Generates text, images, audio, or code
- Examples:
  - ChatGPT (text)
  - DALL·E / Midjourney (images)
  - Music and video generation tools

**Key Difference:**  
> Traditional AI predicts. Generative AI creates.

---

### 3.3 What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI models trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.

LLMs do **not** “know” things the way humans do.  
They predict the **next most likely word** based on patterns learned from data.

**Popular LLM-based tools:**
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Gemini (Google)
- Claude (Anthropic)
- LLaMA (Meta)

---

### 3.4 Evolution of AI (1950 → Present)

- **1950s:** Alan Turing proposes machine intelligence
- **1960s–1980s:** Rule-based AI systems
- **1990s–2000s:** Machine learning
- **2010s:** Deep learning and big data
- **2020s:** Generative AI and LLMs

Today’s AI boom is driven by:
- Massive data availability
- Powerful computing resources
- Advanced neural networks

---

### 3.5 Prompting Basics

A **prompt** is simply how you ask AI to do something.

Good prompts are:
- Clear
- Specific
- Context-rich

**Example:**

❌ *“Write something about marketing.”*  
✅ *“Write a 200-word LinkedIn post explaining digital marketing to beginners in Nigeria.”*

---

### 3.6 Responsible AI Usage

Responsible AI usage means:
- Protecting privacy
- Avoiding plagiarism
- Checking accuracy
- Avoiding blind dependence
- Using AI as an assistant, not a replacement for thinking

AI can help you — but **you remain responsible for the output**.

---

### 3.7 AI in Daily Life

AI can help you to:
- Learn faster
- Write better
- Plan tasks
- Improve productivity
- Support business decisions
- Enhance creativity
