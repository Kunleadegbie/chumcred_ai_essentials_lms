## 1️⃣ Week Overview

Welcome to **Week 2 — the most important week in this program**.

AI tools like ChatGPT are powerful, but the quality of your results depends entirely on **how you communicate with them**. This week focuses on **prompting**, the skill that separates casual AI users from confident, effective AI users.

By the end of this week, you will understand how to talk to AI properly, structure effective prompts, and consistently get high-quality outputs.

> **Prompting is the new literacy.**  
Those who master it will work faster, learn better, and think more clearly.

---

## 2️⃣ Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 2, you should be able to:

- Explain why prompting is a critical modern skill
- Identify and use different types of prompts
- Apply structured prompting frameworks
- Diagnose weak prompts and improve them
- Use AI effectively for writing, learning, and research
- Confidently guide AI toward the output you want

---

## 3️⃣ Core Reading Content

### 3.1 Why Prompting Is the New Literacy

In the past:
- Literacy meant the ability to read and write
- Digital literacy meant the ability to use computers

Today:
- **Prompt literacy** means knowing how to communicate effectively with AI

AI does not understand intentions or emotions.  
It responds **only to what you clearly instruct**.

The quality of your prompt determines:
- Accuracy
- Depth
- Usefulness
- Tone
- Structure of the output

---

### 3.2 Types of Prompts

Understanding different prompt types helps you control how AI behaves.

---

#### a) Role Prompt

You tell the AI **who it should act as**.

**Example:**
> “Act as an experienced teacher and explain photosynthesis to a 10-year-old.”

**Why it works:**  
AI adapts tone, depth, and language to match the role.

---

#### b) Command Prompt

You give a **direct instruction**.

**Example:**
> “Summarize this article in 5 bullet points.”

**Best for:**
- Speed
- Simple tasks
- Clear, focused outputs

---

#### c) Step-by-Step Prompt

You ask AI to **break its thinking into steps**.

**Example:**
> “Explain how to start a small business step by step.”

**Best for:**
- Learning new topics
- Complex explanations
- Clear reasoning

---

#### d) Correction / Refinement Prompt

You improve or adjust earlier output.

**Examples:**
- “Rewrite this in simpler language.”
- “Make it shorter and more professional.”

This is how professionals **iterate** with AI.

---

### 3.3 Prompt Engineering Frameworks

Frameworks help you create powerful prompts consistently.

---

#### RACE Framework

- **Role** – Who should the AI act as?
- **Action** – What should it do?
- **Context** – Background or target audience
- **Expectation** – Format, length, tone

**Example:**
> “Act as a career coach. Rewrite my CV summary for a fresh graduate applying for a bank role. Keep it under 100 words.”

---

#### CRAFT Framework

- **Context**
- **Role**
- **Action**
- **Format**
- **Tone**

This framework is widely used in professional and corporate environments.

---

#### Tree-of-Thought (ToT)

You instruct AI to **reason through multiple paths** before answering.

**Example:**
> “Think through this problem step by step and evaluate different possible solutions before choosing the best one.”

**Best for:**
- Decision-making
- Analysis
- Strategy

---

### 3.4 Bad Prompts vs Powerful Prompts

❌ **Bad Prompt**  
> “Explain marketing.”

**Problems:**
- Too broad
- No audience
- No context

✅ **Powerful Prompt**  
> “Explain digital marketing to a beginner entrepreneur in Nigeria using simple examples.”

---

### 3.5 Using AI for Writing, Learning & Research

Effective prompting allows you to:
- Simplify complex topics
- Generate study notes
- Rewrite content at different difficulty levels
- Ask follow-up questions
- Explore ideas without fear

Think of AI as:
> **A patient tutor that never gets tired.**
